🔹 Prerequisites

Access to SentinelOne Management Console

You need a valid account.

From the console, you download the Linux agent package (.deb) and get the site token.

System requirements (Ubuntu 24.04)

Kernel supported (S1 Linux agent works with recent kernels, but check console release notes).

Root or sudo access.

No conflicting security software.

🔹 Installation Steps
1. Update your system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2. Install required dependencies
sudo apt install -y curl ca-certificates gnupg lsb-release

3. Download the SentinelOne agent

Log into your SentinelOne Management Console

Go to: Settings → Downloads → Agents

Select Linux → Ubuntu/Debian (.deb) and copy the download link.

On your Ubuntu machine:

wget https://<your-sentinelone-console-link>/linux/SentinelAgent_x.y.z.deb -O SentinelAgent.deb

4. Install the package
sudo dpkg -i SentinelAgent.deb
sudo apt --fix-broken install -y

5. Activate the agent

Replace <SITE_TOKEN> with the token from your console.

sudo /opt/sentinelone/bin/sentinelctl management token set <SITE_TOKEN>


Then restart the agent:

sudo systemctl restart sentinelone

6. Verify installation

Check agent status:

/opt/sentinelone/bin/sentinelctl status


You should see info about Connectivity, Protection, and Last Seen.

🔹 Common Issues

Kernel module not loading → Ensure linux-headers-$(uname -r) is installed.

sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r)


Token invalid → Double-check you copied the site token from your console.

Ubuntu 24 not listed → Sometimes agent release lags; you can use the Debian 12 package as it’s compatible.

Do you want me to also make you a bash automation script for Ubuntu 24 SentinelOne installation (so you just run one script with your token)?

Good question 👍 — SentinelOne (S1) agent for Linux is pretty lightweight compared to full SIEM/EDR stacks, but hardware requirements still matter depending on whether you’re talking about:

Endpoint (Agent on Ubuntu 24 host/server)

Management Console (Cloud or On-Prem)

Since your question is Ubuntu 24 + S1 install, I’ll assume you mean endpoint hardware requirements.
